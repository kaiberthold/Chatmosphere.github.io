### Dynamic Conversations in Video Calls

We are a small group of friendly humans working on an open source project to make informal video calls more fun and dynamic. 

The idea came up during the first SARS-CoV-2 shutdown, when some of us as members of the coop TRINK—GENOSSE started a [virtual bar](https://trink-genosse.de/virtuelle-bar/). We found informal group conversations restricting and hierarchical, as the majority of tools is created to enable (corporate) meeting culture. Where were the dynamics of a self-organizing crowd hanging out at one big table together? The big table, where so many jokes, comforting talks, discussions and encounters happen. Where utopias and ideas would emerge?

It's our goal to find interaction patterns that enable informal, unmoderated video calls. It's our hypothesis, that we can prototype these interactions bases on spatialized sound.

This project is open source, based on the jitsi API and funded by the [Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.de/project/chatmosphere/) from September 2020 to February 2021.
